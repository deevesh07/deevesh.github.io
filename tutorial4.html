  <p class="red"><strong>Short Story:</strong> <span class="story-title">The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf</span></p>

<div class="green-line"></div>

  <p>A <strong>shepherd</strong> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.</p>

  <p>One day while <strong>grazing</strong> the sheep, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!” Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn’t find any wolf.</p>

  <p>The boy laughed and replied, “It was just fun. There is no wolf here”. <span class="highlight">The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</span></p>

  <p>After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, “Wolf! Wolf! <s>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!</s>”</p>

  <p><span class="purple">The farmers thought the boy was playing mischief again.</span> So, no one paid attention to him and didn’t come to his help.</p>

  

  <p class="moral">Moral: No one believes a liar even if they speak the truth once.</p>
