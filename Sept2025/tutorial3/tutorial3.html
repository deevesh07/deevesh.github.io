<p>
A <b>shepherd</b> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields<br> 
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wantes to ave some fun.<br>

One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep,he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying <br>
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for helo but <br>
didn't find any wolf.<br>


The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". The boy <br>
played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.<br>

After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the ield with the herd of sheep, <br>
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attackes one of rhe lambs. <br>
<b>The boy was frihtened and cried loudly. "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying away a <br>
lamb!"</strike></b><br>

<font color=purple>The <sub>farmers</sub> thought the boy was playing <sup>mischef</sup> again.</font> So, no one paid attention <br>
to him and didn't come to his help.<br>
